### Variant Markers

These classes don't apply styles themselves; their sole purpose is to mark an element so it can be targeted or referenced by a variant on another element. 

Examples:
 - `peer` is used by elements with the peer variant, to select a sibling 
 - `group` is used on parent elements of the group variants, to select an ancestor
